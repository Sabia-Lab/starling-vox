            "Lecture recordings, in-class quizzes, and how available the TAs were for help.",
            "The way the course was designed helped me stay engaged.",
            "The lab sessions.",
            "1. Learning new tools like Arduino  2. Working with real hardware  3. The bonus challenges",

            "- Teaching assistants  - Small coding tasks  - Field work",
            "I liked: a) how interactive the lectures were  b) working in teams  c) the practical use cases we explored",
            "In my opinion, the course covered too much, but I did enjoy learning Python, doing the group project, and seeing how coding applies to the real world.",
            "Just the Arduino kits \u2014 they were fun.",
            "1. Structured assignments  2. Good use of Canvas  3. Clear grading criteria",
            "Everything felt useful! Especially the hardware demos and how the TAs handled questions.",
            "The teacher, the teacher, the teacher!",
            "Honestly, just two things: 1. Working with real devices  2. The Volvo visit",
            "I liked the vibe of the course and how it encouraged us to be creative.",
            "Field trip, the Skagerrak thing, and the lab sessions. Those stood out.",
            "1. Physical computing aspect  2. Weekly reflection tasks  3. Open Q&A style lectures",
            "A very friendly environment, lots of chances to ask questions, and great slides.",
            "Too much theory at times, but I loved the applied labs and the final demo day.",
            "The R/V Skagerrak was awesome. Working with hardware was new for me. Also, thanks for recording some of the lectures!",
            "I mostly liked how we could talk to the TAs anytime. Also, I got to code in C for the first time."
